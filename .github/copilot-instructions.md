3D Geometric Models of Cephalopod Shells
Mathematical models can accurately capture the 3D geometry of shell-bearing cephalopods (nautiloids, ammonites, belemnites, Spirula, etc.), enabling realistic rendering of their coiled shells. Classic shells grow as a logarithmic spiral – the aperture expands and coils outward in a self-similar way​

researchgate.net
. This growth produces a variety of morphologies (planispiral coils, helically wound spires, straight orthocones) that can be described with a few key parameters​

. Below we summarize the major parametric models and features, including coiling equations, whorl expansion, siphuncle and chamber geometry, ornamentation, ontogeny, and even fossil distortion. 

Examples of shell-bearing cephalopods and their internal structure: (A) a planispiral ammonite (Cadoceras sp.), (C) the modern pearly Nautilus (Nautilus pompilius), and (E) the internal open-coiled shell of Spirula spirula. The right images show the external shell shapes (planispiral vs. open spiral), while the left images are cut-away sections showing septa and chambers. Nautilus has simple concave septa (“synclastic” shape, D) whereas the ammonite’s septa (B) are frilled (anticlastic) and Spirula’s septa (F) are domed. The scale bars (0.13 mm for B, 21.4 mm for C, 2.69 mm for E) indicate the size of each shell or septal detail.
Coiling Geometry and Parametric Models
Early researchers recognized that cephalopod shells follow equiangular spiral growth. D’Arcy Thompson (1917) noted the “logarithmic spiral” form of mollusk shells​
deepseanews.com
, and paleontologist David Raup formalized this with a simple parametric model in the 1960s. Raup’s model describes a shell as a tube (the generating curve) expanding and coiling around an axis, defined by just a few parameters​
deepseanews.com
​
deepseanews.com
:
Whorl Expansion Rate (W) – how fast the tube (aperture) expands in size as it coils. For example, a larger $W$ means each whorl is significantly larger in radius than the previous one​
deepseanews.com
.
Distance from Coiling Axis (D) – how far the generating tube is offset from the central axis. This controls coil tightness: a low $D$ yields a tightly coiled shell (whorls overlap), while a high $D$ produces an “unwound” spiral with whorls separated or only touching at the inner edges​
deepseanews.com
​
digitalatlasofancientlife.org
.
Translation (T) – how much the tube shifts along the axis per revolution. $T=0$ means the coil lies in one plane (planispiral); $T>0$ produces a helically wound shell (like a high-spired snail) that moves upward with each turn​
deepseanews.com
.
Generating Curve Shape (S) – the profile of the aperture itself (e.g. circular, oval, or with ribs). This defines the cross-section of the tube and can incorporate relief like ribs or keels​
deepseanews.com
.
Using these parameters, one can write equations for the shell surface. For instance, in a simple case the whorl radius grows exponentially with coil angle (a logarithmic spiral: $r(\theta)=r_0 e^{k\theta}$), and if $T\neq0$ the axis coordinate increases (e.g. $z(\theta)=T\cdot \theta$ for a constant translation per radian). These form the basis for generating the 3D shell surface​
en.wikipedia.org
​
en.wikipedia.org
. By adjusting $W,D,T,S$, Raup’s model can recreate a huge range of shell forms, from tightly coiled nautilus-like shapes to elongated snail shells. Indeed, Raup found many theoretically possible combinations that never evolved in nature​
digitalatlasofancientlife.org
, highlighting biological constraints on shell form. To capture more irregular or loosely coiled shells, later models extended this framework. Okamoto’s “growing tube” model (1988) uses differential geometry to describe any coiled shell as a curve in space with a expanding tube around it​
palass.org
. Okamoto defines three parameters as continuous functions along the growth: E (radius enlarging ratio, akin to $W$), C (curvature of the coiling path), and T (torsion of the path)​
palass.org
. Curvature and torsion describe the 3D trajectory of the shell’s centerline, while the enlarging ratio describes how the tube radius increases. This approach handles heteromorph ammonites with irregular coils: for example, a near-zero curvature and torsion produces a straight orthocone, constant curvature with zero torsion gives a planispiral, and nonzero torsion yields a helix. By integrating these parameters, one can generate complicated shapes like those of Nipponites (a wildly coiled ammonite) with perfect self-similarity at each growth stage​
palass.org
. The advantage of such parametric models is that they maintain geometric similitude through growth – the shell’s form at any stage is a scaled/rotated version of its form at an earlier stage​
palass.org
, which is ideal for comparing morphology and simulating growth in 3D.
Planispiral Shells: Nautilus and Ammonites
Planispiral shells (coiled in a single plane) are characteristic of modern Nautilus and most ammonites. In these shells, the translation parameter is essentially zero, so the coil does not move up or down – it forms a flat spiral. Growth is nearly logarithmic: as the animal ages, each new whorl expands outward but the overall shape remains similar (an equiangular spiral)​
researchgate.net
. For example, the extant Nautilus follows “Moseley’s law” of geometric similarity, adding chambers such that the spiral angle remains constant. In modeling terms, Nautilus can be assigned a fixed whorl expansion $W$ (on the order of ~1.3) and a moderate $D$ so that whorls touch and overlap moderately (creating a central void called the umbilicus). Many ammonites also closely fit such logarithmic spirals​
researchgate.net
, though slight deviations (allometry) occur during ontogeny (see further below). Raup’s parameters readily describe the spectrum of planispiral conch shapes observed in fossils. A small distance from axis ($D$) and high expansion ($W$) yields an involute shell – whorls overlap tightly, leaving a small umbilicus (as in some nautilids). In contrast, a large $D$ (whorls coiling further from the center) produces an evolute shell with a wide open umbilicus​
digitalatlasofancientlife.org
. Paleontologists quantify this with indices: the umbilical width index (UWI) = umbilicus diameter / shell diameter. In involute ammonites UWI is low (<0.15), whereas evolute forms have higher UWI (whorls barely overlapping)​
researchgate.net
. Similarly, the whorl’s cross-section shape is described by a whorl width index (WWI) = thickness / diameter. Species range from discoidal (compressed, flat whorls, low WWI) to globular (sphaeroconic) shells with rotund whorls (high WWI)​
researchgate.net
. These traditional measurements correspond directly to model parameters: e.g. a high expansion rate $W$ and/or high translation can make the shell thicker relative to its diameter, while $D$ influences how much whorls overlap (affecting UWI). Internally, planispiral shells consist of a series of chambers (the phragmocone) separated by curving septa, with the animal living in the last open chamber (body chamber)​
researchgate.net
. The soft body occupies the body chamber, and as the animal grows it periodically secretes a new septum behind it, closing off the older chamber. A vascular strand called the siphuncle runs through each septum, linking all chambers and regulating buoyancy by gas/water exchange​
researchgate.net
. Nautilus has a siphuncle that runs through the center of each chamber (central position), whereas ammonites typically had the siphuncle along the outer (ventral) margin of the coil​
en-academic.com
. This difference is important in modeling internal geometry: a Nautilus septum will have a central perforation, while an ammonite septum’s siphuncle hole is offset near the outer whorl wall. The septal shape also differs. Nautiloids have simple concave septa (curving like shallow bowls toward the shell’s opening), sometimes called synclastic septa. Ammonoid septa, in contrast, are highly folded at the edges, producing complex wavy suture lines where the septum meets the outer shell. These fluted septa (termed anticlastic in shape) increase the mechanical strength of the shell. Recent simulations demonstrate that the fractal-like complexity of ammonite septa significantly improved shell stability against predators and hydrostatic pressure​
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
​
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Any comprehensive model for ammonites should thus incorporate the septum morphology – at least in a simplified way – since it affects internal volume and strength. In practice, researchers may model the septa as periodic internal partitions (e.g. one septum every 180° or 360° of coil) with a given geometry. For example, septa can be approximated by mathematical surfaces (part of a sphere, torus, etc.) that intersect the whorl. Ammonitic sutures defy simple equations, but can be generated algorithmically or scanned from fossils​
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In summary, planispiral shell models typically use a fixed coiling axis (no tilt), a constant expansion rate, and a generating cross-section swept around. They can recreate the full range of ammonoid shapes by tuning $W,D,T$ – from serpenticone (slender, tightly coiled) to cadicone (very inflated) forms. For instance, increasing $D$ while holding $W$ moderate will produce an evolute discus-shaped ammonite, whereas keeping $D$ low but making $W$ large yields an involute thick-whorled form. The Raupian model and its derivatives (e.g. Westermann morphospace plots) explicitly link such parameter values to known morphotypes​

. This makes them extremely useful for paleo-biological simulations – researchers can plug in the parameters of a real fossil species and obtain a virtual shell for analysis (surface area, volume, hydrostatics, etc.). Indeed, software tools exist that generate shells from Raup’s parameters​

Heteromorph and Helical Shells
Not all ammonoid shells were neat planispirals. Heteromorph ammonites especially (common in the Cretaceous) developed unorthodox coiling – some uncoiled after an initial spiral, some formed helices, and others (like Nipponites) made a tangled, hook-shaped coil. Traditional Raup-style parameters can still describe these if we allow unusual values (e.g. very high $D$ such that whorls don’t touch, or nonzero $T$ to move the coil out of the plane). For example, a helical shell can be modeled by taking a constant curvature (so the spiral path is a circle) but adding a constant translation $T$ per turn – this generates a helix (a 3D spiral like a corkscrew). Some ammonites like Turrilites and Baculites essentially did this: Turrilites coils helically upward, and Baculites is an extreme case where the coil radius grows so large (or curvature so low) that the shell is nearly straight. However, many heteromorphs change curvature over their length (e.g. start planispiral then uncoil). Here, moving-frame models like Okamoto’s are very powerful. By specifying the curvature $C(s)$ and torsion $T(s)$ as functions of arc length (or growth step $s$), one can make the shell’s path bend and twist in arbitrary ways​
palass.org
. For instance, Nipponites can be described as a series of semicircular arcs in alternating directions – effectively a curvature that oscillates in sign – combined with varying torsion to move the coil out of plane. Okamoto showed that by fitting different growth phases (with fairly constant curvature/torsion in each phase), one can identify stable stages vs. transitions in a species’ ontogeny​
palass.org
. The shell remains self-similar within each stage, but the parameters shift when the growth pattern changes (e.g. when an ammonite stops coiling and begins to straighten out). This kind of model can reproduce complex heteromorph geometries in 3D and was even used to render computer-generated shells matching real heteromorph specimens​
palass.org
. An alternative approach is to treat the shell as always following a local growth rule but allow that rule to change. For example, one can combine two Raup-style growth regimes: a tightly coiled segment followed by an uncoiled segment. The transitions can be smoothed to avoid kinks. Some studies refer to this as a “two-stage Raup model” for heteromorphs​
pubs.geoscienceworld.org
. But the most general solution is indeed the differential geometry method – effectively tracing the shell’s centerline as a space curve. Curvature (C) sets how tightly it bends (inverse of a radius of curvature) and torsion (T) sets how much it departs from a plane. A pure planispiral has constant $C>0, T=0$; a straight line has $C=0$; a helix has constant $C>0, T>0$. By varying these, any trajectory is possible. Okamoto’s parameters $E, C, T$​
palass.org
 correspond respectively to shell expansion, bending, and twisting – a concise descriptor for any “free-form” shell. One important heteromorph example is Spirula. Spirula spirula (the ram’s horn squid) has a internal planispiral shell that is open-coiled (whorls do not touch). Geometrically, Spirula’s shell is like a tightly wound helix that has curled back onto itself in a flat plane – often described as an “open planispiral”​
en.wikipedia.org
. In modeling terms, its $D$ is large enough that each whorl is separate, and its expansion rate $W$ is relatively low (the whorl diameter does not increase drastically). Spirula also coils endogastrically (opposite direction to nautilus, affecting orientation of septa). The Spirula shell can be modeled with a Raup model using a high $D$ (no contact), a moderate $W$, and $T=0$ (flat coil). The siphuncle in Spirula is marginal on the inner curve of the spiral​
en.wikipedia.org
 (since Spirula is a coleoid, this inner side corresponds to its ventral side). A segmented model with small regularly spaced septa can capture its chambered structure. Indeed, CT-scans and 3D models of Spirula (see image above) show about 30 chambers in an open spiral, with each septum slightly domed and a thin siphuncle tube along the inner wall​
en.wikipedia.org
​
en.wikipedia.org
. In summary, helically coiled and uncoiled shells are well handled by allowing nonzero translation and variable curvature in the models. The equations remain parametric (just functions of angle or length). These models are very usable: one can program a “turtle graphics” style growth – at each small time step, move forward and turn by an angle (for curvature) and tilt by an angle (for torsion), while enlarging the cross-section (for expansion). The result is a polyline or spline in 3D that can be swept by the aperture shape to form the shell surface. Modern computational tools have employed this to digitally print 3D models of heteromorph ammonites for testing their buoyancy and hydrodynamics​

Orthoconic Shells and Belemnite Structure
An end-member of shell coiling is the orthocone – a straight, conical shell with essentially zero curvature. Many Paleozoic nautiloids (e.g. Orthoceras) had long orthoconic shells, and some ammonites (like Baculites) adopted a straight shell in adulthood. Belemnites (Jurassic–Cretaceous coleoids) are a special case: they had an internal shell consisting of a small chambered phragmocone that is roughly orthoconic, surrounded at the rear by a thick calcareous guard (rostrum) that forms a bullet-like shape​
en.wikipedia.org
. From a modeling perspective, an orthoconic shell can be treated as a spiral with an infinite coiling radius or zero curvature – essentially $D$ becomes very large relative to the shell’s diameter, so the coil unwinds into a straight line. The whorl expansion $W$ still governs how fast the cone widens toward the aperture. Many orthocones maintain a nearly constant taper angle, meaning $W$ is modest (the shell diameter increases gradually along its length). The apex of the shell is a pointed initial chamber (the protoconch), and septa are added as the animal grows forward. For a belemnite phragmocone, one could define $W$ such that the cone diameter increases slightly over the length (some belemnite phragmocones expand then truncate). The siphuncle in belemnites is ventral (running along the lower edge of the chambers)​
en-academic.com
, similar to ammonites, so the septa would be modeled with an off-center perforation. The septa in belemnites tend to be simpler concave shapes. Because the phragmocone is encased in the guard, its exact outer shape is often inferred from cross-sections. For simplicity, one might model the phragmocone as a cone of length X and base radius Y, divided by septa at interval Z. The guard (rostrum) of a belemnite is not chambered but solid calcite. It tapers to a point at the posterior end. In a full 3D model, the guard can be represented as a continuation of the shell cone with a different material and a perhaps slightly different taper. Some have modeled the guard by fitting a quadratic or exponential profile to its radius vs. length to replicate the shape of real specimens (since guards can be elongate or short). For example, an “ideal” guard might be a cone that is about twice the length of the phragmocone, enclosing the phragmocone’s apical region. The important distinction is that the guard does not grow by accretion at an aperture; instead, it likely grew by thickening around the phragmocone. Thus, in simulations one might treat the guard as a separate geometric object rather than an extension of the coiling parameters. Even without a guard, orthoconic shells can be analyzed with the same metrics as coiled shells. Researchers speak of longicones (elongate, gently tapering orthocones) versus brevicones (short, stout cones) – these correlate with whorl expansion rate and overall shell proportions. For instance, a longicone has a small apical angle (almost cylindrical) and many chambers, whereas a brevicone has a large apical angle. In theoretical models, a longicone might have $W$ close to 1 (little expansion per chamber) while a brevicone has higher $W$. Septal spacing is another parameter: some orthocones had closely spaced septa, others widely spaced. If needed, one can specify the number of septa or chambers per unit length in a parametric model. In belemnites, the phragmocone was relatively short and front-loaded (toward the head), and the guard forms most of the “shell” length​
en.wikipedia.org
. As a result, the living animal’s center of buoyancy and mass are influenced by both parts. Recent work on virtual belemnite models and related forms (like Baculites) use 3D reconstructions that include the phragmocone and partial guard to calculate buoyancy and stability​
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
​
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These digital models confirm that a straight shell has very different hydrodynamics than a coiled one, but with proper weighting (the guard acting as a counterweight) the belemnite could achieve neutral buoyancy and a horizontal orientation in life​
en-academic.com
​
link.springer.com
. To summarize, orthoconic models are a limiting case of the coiling equations – essentially the spiral’s radius of curvature is so large that the shell is straight. They are easy to represent parametrically (e.g. by a linear or exponential radius function along an axis). Belemnite shells combine such an orthoconic chambered part with an enveloping solid part; while the guard doesn’t follow the usual accretionary spiral growth, its shape can be captured by traditional geometric measurements (length, diameter profile) and included in 3D simulations of the whole organism.
External Ornamentation (Ribbing and Ornament)
Beyond overall shape, cephalopod shells often bear ornamentation – ribs, growth lines, spines, knobs, etc. These features can also be described parametrically or mathematically, superimposed on the smooth shell geometry. In ammonites, radial ribs are common: these are raised ridges that run across the whorl (from the umbilical edge toward the outer rim) and repeat periodically along the spiral. One way to model ribs is to treat them as a periodic modulation of the shell’s generating curve. For example, one can introduce a sinusoidal variation in the whorl radius or shell thickness as a function of the coiling angle $\theta$. If the rib frequency is $n$ ribs per whorl, one would impose a wave of that frequency around the aperture. As the shell grows, the aperture’s outline “remembers” these modulations, and a spiral rib appears on the surface. Essentially, ribs are “fossilized” growth increments – the shell secretes material at a slightly faster rate at certain intervals, producing a ridge (or leaves a gap, producing a groove). In fact, fine growth lines and coarser lirae on ammonites are precisely such records of episodic growth​
researchgate.net
​
researchgate.net
. They can be spaced very closely (on the order of 0.1 mm for growth lines​
researchgate.net
) or further apart for thicker ribs. From a data standpoint, paleontologists measure rib features with parameters like rib index (number of ribs per whorl) and ratios of rib height/spacing. These can feed into modeling. For instance, to add ribs to a virtual shell, one could set an amplitude (rib height) and wavelength (along the whorl). Checa et al. (1996) showed that rib strength often covaries with whorl shape – stout whorls tend to have stronger ribs​
researchgate.net
. This suggests one might tie rib amplitude to other parameters (a thick whorl model might include prominent ribs). Ornamentation can be broadly categorized as radial (transverse to coiling, like ribs running outward) versus spiral (longitudinal along the coil, like spiral grooves or ridges). Ammonites mostly have radial elements (ribs, tubercles) because the accretion is in the growing direction. Some also have spiral ornament (e.g. Lytoceras has spiral grooves), which could be modeled as a variation that is a function of the height on the whorl rather than the angle​
researchgate.net
. In modeling terms, a spiral ridge might be implemented by altering the generating curve shape (S) – for example, making the aperture cross-section slightly lobate rather than perfectly round, so that as it coils it creates a helical stripe on the shell. Radial ribs, on the other hand, come from time-periodic changes in growth. Spines and nodes (pointed protuberances) can be seen as extreme ribs that localize at certain positions. They might be added by temporarily increasing shell thickness at specific growth intervals or by adding small cone shapes at certain angles. For example, some ammonites have regularly spaced tubercles (bumps) on every rib or every few ribs. A model could mark those angular positions and add a protrusion geometry. These are detail-level features that are usually added on top of the primary shell surface. What do sources say about ornament mathematically? Klug et al. (2015) note that all ammonoids have some form of growth line or rib on the shell​
researchgate.net
. Ribs can vary in strength, spacing, and orientation, often changing during growth (ontogeny)​
researchgate.net
. For instance, an ammonite might start with fine ribs and develop coarse ribs later, or the rib direction may sweep forward or backward relative to the aperture (termed prorsiradiate vs rursiradiate ribs, meaning slanting toward or away from the shell’s opening)​
researchgate.net
. Such orientation can be quantified by measuring the rib’s angle to the shell radius​
researchgate.net
. In modeling, this would affect how the waveform for ribs is phased relative to the aperture plane. One computational approach to ornament is to derive it from the aperture shape over time. Since each rib was once the edge of the aperture at a growth halt, one could simulate the shell growing in pulses. Each time growth stops, the aperture leaves an imprint (a slight thickening or projection). If the aperture at that moment had a particular shape (say, a protruding ventro-lateral area that will form a tubercle), that shape gets recorded as a rib or spine when growth resumes. This method ties ornamentation to the animal’s growth behavior (periodic halts or cyclic growth rates), which is biologically plausible​
researchgate.net
. For rendering purposes, however, it’s often simpler to directly impose a pattern. In summary, to include ribbing and ornamentation in 3D shell models, one adds additional parametric functions on top of the base surface. Radial ribs = periodic radius perturbation as a function of coiling angle; spiral ornament = modulation of the generating curve around its circumference. These features can be calibrated with fossil data (e.g. number of ribs per whorl, rib index)​
researchgate.net
. By citing these values, a modeler can ensure the virtual shell has the same rib frequency and relative height as the real shell. This is important for realistic appearance and also for functional studies (ribs can affect hydrodynamics by increasing drag or turbulence).
Ontogenetic Change in Shell Shape
Cephalopod shells rarely grow with perfectly constant parameters throughout the animal’s life. Ontogenetic development often leads to changes in shell morphology – something models must accommodate. In many ammonoids, juvenile whorls differ from adult whorls (e.g. the shell may start more involute then become evolute, or ribs may appear only after a certain size). Mathematically, this means the coiling parameters $W, D, T$ (and ornament parameters) are functions of growth stage. A simple way to handle this is piecewise: divide the shell into growth intervals (juvenile, subadult, adult) and assign different parameter values to each. More advanced models let parameters vary continuously as a function of whorl angle or shell diameter. Empirical studies confirm that allometric growth is common – shell parameters change nonlinearly with size​
researchgate.net
. For example, in some species the whorl expansion rate $W$ increases slightly during the early whorls (making the shell relatively more inflated as it grows), then stabilizes. This would appear as a curvature in a log-log plot of shell measurements​
researchgate.net
. In the model, one could implement $W(\theta)$ that increases over a certain angular interval. Similarly, the rib index might drop as the shell grows (meaning ribs spread out when the shell gets larger), etc. Okamoto (1988) explicitly analyzed ontogenetic changes using his growing-tube model: by examining the curvature/torsion parameters over the shell, he identified stable stages vs. transitions​
palass.org
. A stable stage is when the coiling geometry remains roughly constant (resulting in evenly spaced whorls or a consistent uncoiling rate), whereas a transition stage is when the shell’s direction or rate of expansion changes (for instance, an ammonite beginning to uncoil its final whorl). In modeling terms, one might hold parameters constant for 360° or more (stable phase), then smoothly interpolate to a new set of parameters (transition). The outcome is a realistic ontogeny: the model shell might start as tightly coiled, then gradually loosen the coil and thicken the whorl in the adult stage, mirroring what real specimens show. A concrete example is an ammonite that becomes body-chamber uncoiled at maturity. Paleontologists observe that some ammonites (e.g. scaphitids) have a last whorl that bends away from the previous coil – this is interpreted as a mature modification. A model could simulate this by increasing the distance from axis $D$ significantly after a certain whorl angle (so the last portion spirals outward), or by adding a sharp bend (curvature jump) in the trajectory. If we were animating the growth, we’d see the shell suddenly “unhook” – which is exactly what the fossil record shows at the adult body chamber. Such changes often coincide with attainment of sexual maturity, and can be detected by changes in ornament (like the appearance of final thickened ribs called growth striae or constrictions​
researchgate.net
 marking the end of growth). Even in Nautilus, which is relatively consistent, there are ontogenetic shifts: the early chambers are differently proportioned than later ones. Urdy et al. (2010) and others quantified that parameters in ammonoids are not perfectly linear through ontogeny​
researchgate.net
. This means a single set of Raup parameters might fit an adult whorl but not the entire shell. Therefore, when using these models, researchers often fit them segment by segment. For instance, Korn & Klug (2003) measured whorl profiles at different growth stages and could detect where the expansion rate changes​
researchgate.net
. The Westermann morphospace approach also can be extended ontogenetically: one can plot the trajectory of an individual shell through the parameter space as it grows. Many ammonites migrate through morphospace during development (e.g., start in the spheroconic region and move toward the oxyconic region). This is a useful way to visualize ontogeny. It underscores that our models shouldn’t assume a static geometry if we want to capture the full life history. In practical modeling, implementing ontogeny might mean writing the parametric equations with growth-dependent terms. For example: $W(\theta) = W_0 + \Delta W \cdot f(\theta)$, where $f(\theta)$ is some sigmoid or step function that changes around the desired stage. Likewise, one could gradually shift the generating cross-section from one shape to another (to simulate, say, a juvenile shell that is narrower and an adult shell that is broader). Another approach is literally to model the shell growth stepwise: generate a geometry for each successive chamber using possibly updated parameters at each step (this is computationally intensive but mimics real growth). Ontogenetic changes in ornamentation are also notable. Ammonites often modify ribbing as they grow – e.g., developing spines after a certain diameter, or changing rib direction. The model can accommodate that by altering the rib function after a threshold. Indeed, Klug et al. (2015) point out that “significant changes during ontogeny may be observed” in rib shape and strength​
researchgate.net
. An example: early whorls of an ammonite might be smooth, then at a given size it starts forming ribs. In the model, one could keep rib amplitude at zero until reaching that whorl and then ramp it up. In summary, ontogeny adds a dynamic aspect to shell models. Rather than single values for each parameter, we have parameter trajectories. Modern modeling often incorporates this because it yields more accurate reconstructions of fossils. A single ammonite shell, when digitally reconstructed chamber by chamber, reveals how its coiling loosened or tightened as it grew. Such reconstructions, when compared across species, inform us about evolutionary developmental biology (e.g., how developmental timing changes might produce different adult morphologies). The key takeaway is that the mathematical models are flexible enough to include these changes – one just needs to segment or functionally vary the inputs. Preserving self-similarity within stages but allowing shifts between stages can closely mimic real shell ontogeny​

Taphonomic Distortion and Restoration
Fossil cephalopod shells are often deformed by geological processes after the animal’s death, and these taphonomic distortions must be considered when modeling. Commonly, ammonite shells found in sedimentary rock are compressed – the originally circular whorl cross-section becomes flattened into an oval, and the shell may be sheared or fractured. Compression typically occurs during sediment compaction, squashing the shell along one axis. For example, many Jurassic ammonites in shale are “ pancaked” such that their thickness is greatly reduced relative to diameter. Studies have measured deformation ratios; e.g., one analysis found lateral flattening up to ~40% in some localities​
sciencedirect.com
. In less extreme cases, moderate compaction leads to continuous deformation of the shell without breakage – septa and whorls are smoothly bent out of their original curvature​
researchgate.net
. This kind of distortion can be seen in the field as wavy or concave septa that should be planar cuts. When creating a 3D model of a fossil shell, one often wants to restore the original geometry. This can involve applying an inverse transformation to the fossil’s measurements. For instance, if a shell is flattened dorsoventrally by 30%, one can mathematically “unflatten” by expanding that axis of the model by the reciprocal factor. Geometric morphometric techniques have been developed to detect and correct such deformation. One approach is to assume the shell was originally axisymmetric (round whorl) and find the best ellipse that fits the distorted cross-section, then transform it to a circle. Similarly, if the fossil shows a shear (where the two halves of the whorl are shifted), one can apply a shear matrix to counteract it. Kammerer et al. (2020) describe how taphonomic deformation (compression, shear, etc.) can dominate the variance in shape analysis, potentially obscuring genuine biological differences​
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
​
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In ammonoids, researchers often have to exclude heavily deformed specimens or correct them before comparing species. Some have used the symmetry of septal suture lines as a guide: if a suture (originally symmetric) is skewed, that indicates distortion. For example, a saddle-shaped deformation might cause once-planar suture lines to undulate; by computationally warping the fossil until the suture symmetry is restored, one can approximate the original form. To illustrate, in a Polish Oxfordian ammonite assemblage, authors noted that “compaction is moderate. Shell deformations are usually continuous, resulting in deformation of septa”​

. They likely could measure how septum curvature deviates from the expected. With modern CT-scanning of fossils, it is even possible to do a 3D mesh morphing: essentially applying a digital strain to the scanned shell mesh to inflate it back to a plausible original shape. This often assumes the shell had bilateral symmetry and known proportions (perhaps based on better-preserved relatives). In our context of parametric models, we should be aware that fossils may not directly reflect the ideal parameters. A paleontologist might measure a flattened fossil and get a high WWI (whorl width index), but realize the shell was compressed. Correcting that might lower the WWI to the true value. Thus, when using model equations to fit a fossil, deformation must be accounted for, otherwise the derived parameters could be off. Ideally, sources of error from deformation are noted: e.g., “specimen shows ~20% lateral compression”, and the modeler then increases the appropriate dimension by 20% in the reconstruction. Taphonomic distortion modeling can also be flipped around: Some studies simulate how an originally round shell would look after compression. This is done by applying a flattening transform to the model output. If the simulated deformation matches the fossil, it increases confidence in the interpretation. For instance, computerized tomography (CT) of crushed ammonites allows separation of pieces and virtual “uncrushing” by repositioning fragments. In sum, fossil shells often deviate from theoretical geometry due to burial and diagenesis. Continuous distortions like uniform flattening or simple shear can be described by affine transformations (scaling, skewing). These can be inverted to retrieve original model parameters. When building a comprehensive model, it’s wise to include toggles for taphonomic effects – e.g., one could present a pristine model and then show it after applying a 0.5 flattening factor in one axis, to compare with actual fossil remains. This helps in paleontological reconstructions, ensuring that the mathematical model reflects the biology, not the biases of preservation. By combining careful measurement, assumptions of symmetry, and sometimes trial-and-error, researchers use these models not only to recreate how cephalopod shells looked and functioned in life, but also to correct what millions of years of rock pressure have altered.
